## Problem
Estimating the lighting direction in a face image

## Definition
Given a single-color input face image $I$ , converse the pixels of the image $z=I(x,y)$ at each pixel coordinate $(x,y)$ of image $I$ . Convert the plane in 3D with equation,
$$ax+by+cz+d=0$$
Find out the surface normal $\vec n=[a,b,c]^T$ .


## Input
* single color image

* image of human face

* photo was taken with indoor lighting from a single direction

* pose: front, roughly at eye level


## Output
* A vector representing the lighting direction of the input


## Success Criteria
Calculate the cosine distance between the output vector and the real lighting direction.
For example, $\vec n=[a,b,c]^T$ is the output vector, and $\vec l=[m,n,k]^T$ is the vector of the lighting direction,
$$\cos (\vec n,\vec l)=\sqrt{(a-m)^{2}+(b-n)^{2}+(c-k)^{2}}$$
is the distance between the output direction and the real lighting direction.
If
$$\cos(\vec n,\vec l)\le 0.01$$
then the output should be considered as correct.
If the $correct\ rate\ge 90\%$ , can be considered as good system.
